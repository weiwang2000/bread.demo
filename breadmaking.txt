Bread is made from wheat flour, water, yeast and salt : with these four "simple" raw materials we succeed in making many thousands of different types of bread. Apart from the quality of the raw materials, the process itself has an enormous influence on the final quality of the bread. 

1. The raw materials

1.1. Wheat flour 


In this chapter we talk about the wheat kernel and wheat flour. Which methods are used to determine the quality of the flour: Chopin, amylograph, falling number, moisture content etc. What are flour improvers? What kind of enzymes are present in the flour and what is enzymatic activity in the flour? What is the relationship between the quality of the flour and the quality of bread? What other types of cereals are used in the bakery?

1.2. Water 


Water plays an important role in the production of bread. However bakers normally don't think about the water. It comes out of the tap and that's it. And why is water the best bread improver (and the cheapest) you can get?

1.3. Yeast and sourdough


What is yeast and what is sourdough? General description of yeast and its characteristics. What are lactic acid bacteria? How is sourdough made, what different technologies are used in the different countries of Europe (France, Germany, Italy etc.). What is the difference between a poolish and a sourdough? Why has bread made with sourdough a longer shelf life and why does it tastes better? What is the importance of the temperature, the pH, the quantity of water used etc.? Which aromatic compounds are formed during the sourdough fermentation and how can the ratio between acetic acid and lactic acid be influenced?
