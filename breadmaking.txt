Bread is made from wheat flour, water, yeast and salt : with these four "simple" raw materials we succeed in making many thousands of different types of bread. Apart from the quality of the raw materials, the process itself has an enormous influence on the final quality of the bread. 

1. The raw materials

1.1. Wheat flour 


In this chapter we talk about the wheat kernel and wheat flour. Which methods are used to determine the quality of the flour: Chopin, amylograph, falling number, moisture content etc. What are flour improvers? What kind of enzymes are present in the flour and what is enzymatic activity in the flour? What is the relationship between the quality of the flour and the quality of bread? What other types of cereals are used in the bakery?

1.2. Water 


Water plays an important role in the production of bread. However bakers normally don't think about the water. It comes out of the tap and that's it. And why is water the best bread improver (and the cheapest) you can get?

1.3. Yeast and sourdough


What is yeast and what is sourdough? General description of yeast and its characteristics. What are lactic acid bacteria? How is sourdough made, what different technologies are used in the different countries of Europe (France, Germany, Italy etc.). What is the difference between a poolish and a sourdough? Why has bread made with sourdough a longer shelf life and why does it tastes better? What is the importance of the temperature, the pH, the quantity of water used etc.? Which aromatic compounds are formed during the sourdough fermentation and how can the ratio between acetic acid and lactic acid be influenced?

1.4. Other raw materials: emulsifiers, sugar, malt


Emulsifiers are important ingredients of bread improvers. Why do they improve the bread and what does improvement mean? What role plays sugar and what is the influence of salt? Everybody has heard about enzymes but what are they and which enzymes play an important part in the production of bread?

1.5. Other raw materials: fruits, nuts, eggs etc.


Quite some different ingredients can be added to dough either to make a savoury product or to obtain a luxury product with nuts and raisins for instance. These ingredients also need to be of the highest quality and there are quite some possible issues linked to their use.

1.6. Enzymes


Enzymes are naturally occurring components of many bakery ingredients. If an enzyme is added, it often is destroyed by the heat of the baking process. In both cases, product designers can obtain the functional benefits of the enzyme while maintaining a "clean label" image for the finished product. Enzymes also are specific to a particular function, eliminating concerns about undesired effects. 

3. Quality, recipes and other interesting aspects of bread

3.1. What is quality ?

3.2. Recipes from all over the world


This topic is of course endless and it would be rather impossible to describe here all types of bread. Suffice to say that, if there are in a town 5 bakers, there will be 5 different kinds of bread, because the secret of bread does not lie in the recipe but in the way the product is made. So by definition we had to limit ourselves and we made a choice of a number of products which however are distinct and well know all over the world. So, in this chapter, we describe a number of products and their production methods from a selected number of countries. 

3.3. Staling of bread


The subject of bread staling is certainly not something new and studies on this particular topic go back many years. Various definitions have been given to the term "bread staling." Very broadly speaking, bread staling refers to all of the changes which occur in bread after baking and has been defined as "a term which indicates decreasing consumer acceptance of bakery products by changes in the crumb other than those resulting from action of spoilage organisms." 

3.4. The nutritional value of bread


Nutritious fibres are considered to be an important element in the prevention of the typical prosperity diseases such as obesity, heart conditions and cancer of the bowels. A fibre shortage is not the cause of these diseases, but fibres will slow down the development of these diseases. Especially in the industrialized and well-developed countries, these prosperity diseases appear. Exactly in these places, the use of refined products such as white bread, white rice and white sugar is high. The image of bread as "starchy" or "fattening" is, ironically, contrary to the unique role of cereal grain foods in the history of man.

3.5. The microbiological shelf life of bread


The distribution of fresh bread is a particular problem. The consumer expects a certain microbiological shelf life of bread. Bread that has been packed in a hermetically sealed packet, will stay mould free for a couple of days. Next to the phenomenon of staling, mould will develop. It is even possible that harmful bacteria grow in the bread. This is possible because the crumb of bread has a rather high moisture content. Methods (physical as well as chemical) to extend the mould free shelf life of bread are discussed in this chapter. 

3.6. The history of bread


Look at bread: it is the history of the humanity which you contemplate. Bread is the very base of our food since millennia; it is the privileged witness of the history of mankind and of its civilization. As a spiritual symbol, it has accompanied religious festivals and rites. With the whims of nature and military campaigns, the bread has been token of opulence or misery, of constraint or freedom. Lack of bread caused famine in the Middle-Ages, protests because of the bread price at the dawn of the French revolution, bread rationing during World War II, the success of white bread in the post-war period and until recently the rediscovery of tasty whole grain bread, made with sourdough.

3.7. Allergy and intolerance for bread
